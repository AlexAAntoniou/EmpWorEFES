Kiln documentation
==================

Kiln is an open source multi-platform framework for building and deploying
complex websites whose source content is primarily in XML. It brings together
various independent software components into an integrated whole that provides
the infrastructure and base functionality for such sites.

Kiln is developed and maintained by a team at the Department of Digital
Humanities (DDH), Kingâ€™s College London. Over the past years and versions,
Kiln (formerly called xMod) has been used to generate more than 50 websites
which have very different source materials and customised functionality. Since
DDH has in-house guidelines for using TEI P5 to create websites, Kiln makes
use of certain TEI markup conventions. However, it has been adapted to work on
a variety of flavours of TEI and other XML vocabularies, and has been used to
publish data held in relational databases.
